## Hi there 👋

I'm Tyler, a web developer based in the United States of America

I typically like to work solo, leveraging AI tools to help my build by applications. 

I hope to be able to target specific niches and build tools to help with everyday problems.

This is a very small, personal account where I will be posting progress on the projects that I'm working on. Everything on this page is built from the ground up -- from idea to app.

## Tech stack
Front-end: Next.js, React, Tailwind, Typescript, Radix UI
Back-end: Supabase
AI-tools: Cursor, ChatGPT

## A bit about me
